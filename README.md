# Kisan
##### As the name of the project is self describing, this is the project related to farmers. This was created during the hackathon "Radiance" organized by the PICT, pune. During this frontend hackathon I got a problem statement to create a website which helps farmers in their overall growth. At first this was a simple frontend project; but now I am wanting to create this project as a full fledged website. 

### This project uses following :
 
 - HTML
 - CSS
 - Javascript
 - Bootstrap
 
 ##### I have hosted this project at (https://shyam-lokhande.github.io/Kisan/). Please check it out and let me know if you have any idea to make it better.
 
 ###### Thank You!
